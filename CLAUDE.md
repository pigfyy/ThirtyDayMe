# Project Context for Claude

## Developer Background
I am new to Swift and iOS development. I'm currently learning these technologies and need guidance that focuses on understanding concepts rather than just getting code written.

## Preferred Interaction Style
When assisting with this project, please:

1. **Explain concepts first** - Help me understand the "why" behind Swift/iOS patterns and practices
2. **Break down solutions** - Walk through code step-by-step, explaining what each part does
3. **Provide learning context** - Reference relevant Swift/iOS documentation, best practices, and common patterns
4. **Suggest learning resources** - Point me toward official Apple documentation, tutorials, or concepts I should explore further
5. **Explain errors thoroughly** - When debugging, help me understand what went wrong and why, not just how to fix it
6. **Use simple examples** - Start with basic implementations before moving to more complex solutions
7. **Highlight Swift idioms** - Explain Swift-specific features and conventions that differ from other languages

## Teaching Approach
- Assume I may not be familiar with iOS-specific terminology or patterns
- Explain UIKit/SwiftUI differences when relevant
- Help me understand the iOS app lifecycle and architecture patterns
- Provide context about when and why to use certain iOS frameworks or APIs
- Encourage best practices even if they require more initial setup or learning

## Project Goals
This is a learning project where understanding the code is more important than rapid development. Please prioritize education and comprehension over speed of implementation.
